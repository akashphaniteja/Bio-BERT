**Omdena Reboot Rx Project**

**_Improving the Lives of Cancer Patients by Identifying Existing Non-Cancer Generic Drugs_**

More details at [Omdena/Projects/AI-Cancer](https://omdena.com/projects/ai-cancer/) 

**The Project Goals**

Each year worldwide, 17 MILLION people are diagnosed with cancer, 10 MILLION people die from cancer, and cancer care spending is close to $1 TRILLION. Clinical studies, like clinical trials and observational studies, assess whether a drug intervention is useful for treating a disease. Many clinical studies have evaluated non-cancer generic drugs for the treatment of cancer. Reboot Rx is interested in synthesizing information from publications, using NLP techniques and language models, and describing these studies to identify the most promising repurposing opportunities.

The project is a data extraction and classification exercise to create a structured database of cancer and non-cancer drugs and their response measures in text-based clinical study abstracts.

**Possible Outcomes:**
1. Machine learning model(s) and/or information extraction rules to extract numerical data from clinical study abstracts and classify them with specified outcome labels
2. Code for model training and evaluation
3. Training datasets with curated labels used for model training
4. Code for wrapper functions needed to extract and store data in a structured format
5. Data tables or database with extracted values from a specified list of study abstracts
