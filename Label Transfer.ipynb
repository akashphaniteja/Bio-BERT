Effect of antiviral treatment with nucleotide/nucleoside analogs on postoperative prognosis of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma: a two-stage longitudinal clinical study. TITLE END DRUG NAME: Adefovir Dipivoxil PURPOSE: Postoperative prognosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) -related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poor. The effect of nucleotide/nucleoside analog (NA) treatment on the prognosis has not been fully clarified. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We carried out a two-stage longitudinal study that included a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of NA treatment on postoperative prognosis of HBV-HCC. Seven hundred eighty patients (163 in the RCT) were enrolled onto this study following radical hepatectomy. Lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, or entecavir were postoperatively administered to antiviral groups. Surgical specimens were examined immunohistochemically for carboxylic acid-terminal truncated HBV X protein (Ct-HBx). RESULTS: In the nonrandomized cohort, high viral load (>/= 10(4) copies/mL) significantly predicted unfavorable overall survival and recurrence-free survival (RFS), whereas antiviral treatment significantly improved both types of survival. In the RCT, antiviral treatment significantly decreased HCC recurrence and HCC-related death, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.48 (95% CI, 0.32 to 0.70) and 0.26 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.50), respectively, in multivariate Cox analyses. Patients who received antiviral treatment had significantly decreased early recurrence (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.62) and improved liver function 6 months after surgery compared with the controls (P < .001). Those with recovered liver function had a higher 2-year RFS rate than those without (P = .003). Ct-HBx expression in adjacent hepatic tissues significantly predicted an unfavorable RFS in the antiviral group (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Although it might not affect the HCC-promoting potential of Ct-HBx, NA treatment is effective in normalizing liver function, decreasing HBV-HCC recurrence, and improving postoperative survival. This effect should be validated in a multicenter phase III RCT.\n",

TITLE END DRUG NAME: Amphotericin B Thirty-seven patients with non-small cell carcinoma of the lung were randomized to receive doxorubicin, lomustine, hexamethylmelamine, and methotrexate (ACHM) or ACHM plus amphotericin B (AMB). The complete plus partial response rate was 39% for ACHM plus AMB, compared to 23% for ACHM alone. However, the median duration of complete or partial response was only 3.0 months with ACHM plus AMB, compared to 7.0 months with ACHM. Most importantly, median survival was only 4.0 months with ACHM plus AMB, compared to 8.0 months with ACHM (P = 0.08; two-tail test). Myelosuppression was enhanced by the addition of AMB. Although AMB has biological and antitumor activity in certain clinical circumstances, it does not appear to have a meaningful role in palliative therapy of patients with non-small cell bronchogenic carcinoma.\n",

Randomized phase II trial of weekly dose-intensive chemotherapy or amrubicin plus cisplatin chemotherapy following induction chemoradiotherapy for limited-disease small cell lung cancer (JCOG1011). TITLE END DRUG NAME: Ampicillin OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to select, for a phase III trial, the more promising of weekly-dose intensive chemotherapy or amrubicin+cisplatin chemotherapy as subsequent therapy after induction chemoradiotherapy for previously untreated limited-disease small cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients aged 20-70 years with untreated clinical stage II/III LD-SCLC were eligible. After one cycle of accelerated hyperfractionation thoracic radiotherapy with etoposide plus cisplatin, patients without progression were randomized to either 3 cycles of cisplatin 25mg/m2 (days 1, 8), doxorubicin 40mg/m2 (day 1), etoposide 80mg/m2 (days 1-3), and vincristine 1mg/m2 (day 8) every 2 weeks (CODE) or amrubicin 40mg/m2 (days 1-3) and cisplatin 60mg/m2 (day 1) every 3 weeks (AP). The primary endpoint was the one-year progression-free survival (PFS). The sample size was 72 to select the arm yielding a better one-year PFS (55% vs. 65%) with a probability of 80%. RESULTS: From March 2011 to February 2014, 85 patients were registered. After the induction chemoradiotherapy, 75 patients were randomized to CODE (n=39) or AP (n=36). The one-year PFS (95% confidence interval) was 41.0% (25.7-55.8) in the CODE group and 54.3% (36.6-69.0) in the AP group. Grade 4 neutropenia/grade 3 febrile neutropenia occurred in 47%/16% in the CODE group and 78%/42% in the AP group. CONCLUSION: The one-year PFS was better in the AP group, but it did not reach the expected 55%. Therefore, neither regimen is suitable for a phase III trial.\n",

      "PMID: 12168912  TITLE. A clinical study of taxotere versus taxotere plus the antiprolactinemic agent bromocriptine in metastatic breast cancer pretreated with anthracyclines. TITLE END DRUG NAME: Bromocriptine Prolactin (PRL) constitutes a growth factor for breast cancer cell proliferation and abnormally elevated blood concentrations of PRL are associated with poor prognosis and reduced efficacy of antitumor therapies in metastatic breast carcinoma. It has already been demonstrated that low-dose bromocriptine, an antiprolactinemic long-acting dopaminergic drug, normalizes PRL blood concentrations in metastatic breast cancer patients with abnormally elevated PRL levels. In addition, previous clinical studies have already demonstrated a lower efficacy of chemotherapy with taxotere in metastatic breast cancer, with persistent hyperprolactinemia. We planned a controlled clinical study to evaluate the influence of a concomitant administration of the antiprolactinemic drug bromocriptine on the efficacy of chemotherapy with taxotere, in metastatic breast cancer patients progressing after chemotherapeutic combinations containing anthracyclines. The study included 30 randomized consecutive patients treated with taxotere alone or taxotere plus bromocriptine. Taxotere was given I.V. at 100 mg/m2 every 21 days for 3 cycles. Bromocriptine was given orally at 2.5 mg/day every day until the end of the chemotherapeutic treatment. Bromocriptine therapy induced a significant decline in PRL mean blood concentrations compared to patients treated by chemotherapy alone. No complete response was obtained. A partial response (PR) occurred in 5 out of 14 (36%) patients treated with taxotere plus bromocriptine and in only 2 out of 16 (13%) patients treated with taxotere alone. Moreover, a stable disease (SD) was obtained in 5 out of 16 patients treated with taxotere alone and in 7 out of 14 patients concomitantly treated with bromocriptine. Therefore, the percent of non-progressive disease (PR + SD) achieved in patients treated with taxotere plus bromocriptine was significantly higher with respect to that found in patients treated with taxotere alone (12 out of 14 vs 7 out of 16, p < 0.025). This preliminary clinical study would suggest that the inhibition of PRL secretion by antiprolactinemic drugs such as bromocriptine may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.\n",

      "PMID: 15727424  TITLE. Therapy of glioblastoma multiforme improved by the antimutagenic chloroquine. TITLE END DRUG NAME: Chloroquine OBJECT: Therapy of malignant tumors is frequently curtailed by the emergence of chemoresistant cell clones. Experimentally, the authors have demonstrated that chemotherapy for glioma in rats is markedly improved by the administration of the antimutagenic quinacrine. They studied the effects of chloroquine, an antimutagenic with an optimal pharmacological profile for human use, as adjuvant for the treatment of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). METHODS: In a prospective controlled randomized trial, 18 patients with GBM underwent standard treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy; nine received an additional 150-mg dose of chloroquine daily starting 1 day after surgery and continued through the observation period. Nine matched patients were included as controls. Neuroimaging studies and clinical response were periodically compared. The follow-up period ranged from 24 to 50 months. Survival time was defined as the main outcome measure. Survival was significantly longer in chloroquine-treated patients than in controls (33 +/- 5 and 11 +/- 2 months, respectively [p < 0.0002]). At the end of the observation period, four patients (46%) treated with chloroquine were alive, two had evidence of tumor remission after 2 years; in another two, tumor recurrence developed after 2 and 4 years of remission, respectively. No control patient survived more than 22 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic administration of chloroquine greatly enhanced the response of GBM to antineoplastic treatment. Because the cytotoxicity of chloroquine on malignant cells is negligible, these favorable results appear mediated by its strong antimutagenic effect that precludes the appearance of resistant clones during radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\n",

TITLE END DRUG NAME: Dexrazoxane PURPOSE: Given concerns that dexrazoxane may reduce treatment efficacy, induce second cancers, and thus compromise overall survival among children, we examined long-term overall and cause-specific mortality and disease relapse rates from three randomized clinical trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children's Oncology Group trials P9404 (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma; n = 537), P9425 (intermediate/high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma; n = 216), and P9426 (low-risk Hodgkin lymphoma; n = 255) were conducted between 1996 and 2001. Each trial randomly assigned patients to doxorubicin with or without dexrazoxane. The dexrazoxane:doxorubicin dose ratio was 10:1, and the cumulative protocol-specified doxorubicin dose was 100 to 360 mg/m(2). Dexrazoxane was given as an intravenous bolus before each doxorubicin dose. Data from all three trials were linked with the National Death Index to determine overall and cause-specific mortality by dexrazoxane status. RESULTS: Among 1,008 patients (507 received dexrazoxane) with a median follow-up of 12.6 years (range, 0 to 15.5 years), 132 died (67 received dexrazoxane). Overall mortality did not vary by dexrazoxane status (12.8% with dexrazoxane at 10 years v 12.2% without; hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.45). Findings were similar when each trial was examined separately. Dexrazoxane also was not significantly associated with differential causes of death. The original cancer caused 76.5% of all deaths (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.32) followed by second cancers (13.6% of deaths; HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.49 to 3.15). Specifically, dexrazoxane was not associated with deaths from acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplasia or cardiovascular events. CONCLUSION: Among pediatric patients with leukemia or lymphoma, after extended follow-up, dexrazoxane use did not seem to compromise long-term survival.\n",

TITLE END DRUG NAME: Dextran Estrogen receptor (ER) was estimated immunohistochemically in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue from the primary breast cancer in 349 postmenopausal patients with a high risk of recurrence and compared with the results of dextran-coated charcoal assay. There was a highly significant correlation between the ER classification obtained by the two methods (p less than 10(-6)). Patients ER positive according to immunohistochemical estimate had a significantly longer disease-free survival (p less than 0.001) and survival (p less than 0.001) than ER negative patients. The DCC assay showed an advantage of ER positive patients of the same magnitude. The patients, who were followed for a median of 86 months, were a subset of 1,700 patients participating in the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group's randomized trial of adjuvant tamoxifen (TAM) treatment. In the presently analyzed subset of patients there were no statistically significant difference in disease-free survival (p = 0.52) or survival (p = 0.54) between patients who received adjuvant TAM and the controls. The same was true for receptor-defined subgroups regardless if the ER receptor was estimated in paraffin-embedded tissue or by the dextran-coated charcoal method. The analyzed subset might have been too small for demonstrating a positive effect of adjuvant TAM treatment.\n",

TITLE END DRUG NAME: Dextromethorphan Lenalidomide (Len) plus dexamethasone (Dex) is approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). It is possible that single-agent Len may be effective as prolonged treatment regimen in RRMM once patients demonstrate an initial response to Len+Dex induction. Patients with RRMM who responded to first-line Len+Dex in an observational study (NCT01430546) received up to 24 cycles of either Len (25 mg/day) or Len+Dex (25 mg/day and 40 mg/week) as prolonged treatment in a subsequent phase 2 clinical trial (NCT01450215). In the observational study (N = 133), median time to response was 1.7 (range 0.6-9.6) months. A complete response to all treatments received in both studies was observed in 11% of patients; very good partial response and partial response rates were 31% and 38%, respectively. Corresponding response rates in the subgroup of patients who did not enter the phase 2 trial (n = 71) were 3%, 18%, and 39%, respectively. Rates of disease progression at 2 years in the phase 2 trial were 47% versus 31% for Len versus Len+Dex (P = 0.14). After 36 months median follow-up in surviving patients, median time to progression was not reached with Len+Dex and was 24.9 months (95% confidence interval 12.5-not calculable, P < 0.001) with Len. Three-year OS among the total observational study population was 61% (95% CI, 52-69%). The corresponding rate among patients who entered the phase 2 clinical trial was 73% (95% CI, 60-83%) and was significantly lower among those patients who achieved >/=PR but did not proceed into the phase 2 trial (55%; P = 0.01). In the phase 2 trial, OS was 73% in both treatment arms (P = 0.70). Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were more common with prolonged (phase 2 trial) versus short-term (observational study) Len administration but remained manageable. Prolonged treatment with Len with or without Dex provides sustained, clinically relevant responses and demonstrates an acceptable safety profile.\n",

TITLE END DRUG NAME: Doxercalciferol PURPOSE: Docetaxel is standard of care for androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC). Doxercalciferol (1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D2) had modest activity in phase I/II trials. Preclinical data support combining vitamin D analogues with docetaxel to treat AIPC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Chemotherapy-naive men with metastatic AIPC were randomized 1:1 to receive, on a 4-week cycle, docetaxel (35 mg/m2 i.v., days 1, 8, and 15) with or without doxercalciferol (10 microg orally, days 1-28). The primary end point was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response. Secondary end points were progression-free survival, overall survival, objective response, and toxicity. Survival was analyzed as intent to treat. RESULTS: Seventy patients were randomized. Median follow-up was 17.6 months (range, 3.3-45.2). PSA response rate was 46.7% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 30-64] in the doxercalciferol arm and 39.4% (95% CI, 25-56) with placebo (P = 0.560). Median progression-free survival in the doxercalciferol arm was 6.17 months (95% CI, 4.20-10.7) versus 6.20 months (95% CI, 4.83-9.07) with placebo (P = 0.764). Median overall survival in the doxercalciferol arm was 17.8 months (95% CI, 14.9-23.6) versus 16.4 months (95% CI, 11.9-23.8) with placebo (P = 0.383). Twenty-four patients in the doxercalciferol arm and 23 in the placebo arm were evaluable for objective response. No complete responses were observed. Partial objective response rate was 12.5% with doxercalciferol versus 8.7% with placebo (P = 0.672). Rate of grade > or =3 toxicity was 46% with doxercalciferol versus 42% with placebo (P = 0.785). CONCLUSIONS: Daily doxercalciferol with weekly docetaxel did not enhance PSA response rate or survival. Toxicity was similar between arms. Despite the disappointing results of this study, other vitamin D analogues remain under active investigation.\n",

      "PMID: 28008379  TITLE. A phase 2 trial exploring the clinical and correlative effects of combining doxycycline with bone-targeted therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. TITLE END DRUG NAME: Doxycycline BACKGROUND: Bone-targeting agents (BTAs), such as bisphosphonates and denosumab, have demonstrated no discernable effects on tumour response or disease free/overall survival in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer. Doxycycline is both osteotropic and has anti-cancer effects. When combined with zoledronate in animal models, doxycycline showed significantly increased inhibition of tumour burden and increased bone formation. We evaluated the effects of adding doxycycline to ongoing anti-cancer therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: Breast cancer patients with bone metastases and >/=3 months of BTA use, entered this single-arm study. Patients received doxycycline 100 mg orally, twice a day for 12 weeks. The co-primary endpoints were; effect on validated pain scores (FACT-Bone pain and Brief Pain Inventory) and bone resorption markers (serum C-telopeptide, [sCTx]). All endpoints (pain scores, sCTx, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, skeletal-related events, toxicity) were evaluated at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Bone marrow was sampled at baseline and week 12 for exploratory biomarker analysis. RESULTS: Out of 37 enroled patients, 27 (73%) completed 12 weeks of therapy. No significant changes were seen in pain scores or bone turnover markers. Failure to complete treatment: drug toxicity (70%) and disease progression (30%). Sixteen (43%) patients had GI adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 12 weeks had no significant effects on either bone pain or bone turnover markers. Its toxicity profile in this patient population would make further evaluation challenging.\n",

North Central Cancer Treatment Group Trial 89-30-52. TITLE END DRUG NAME: Fluoxymesterone PURPOSE: This clinical trial evaluated the addition of fluoxymesterone (Flu) to tamoxifen (Tam) in women with resected early stage breast cancer and attempted to corroborate the findings of superiority for the combination over Tam alone seen in a previous randomized trial in metastatic disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer that was known to be estrogen receptor (ER) positive were randomized to treatment with Tam (20 mg per day orally for 5 years) alone or combined with Flu (10 mg orally twice per day for 1 year). The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (RFS) defined as local-regional or distant recurrence including ductal carcinoma in situ of the ipsilateral, but not contralateral breast, and death from any cause. RESULTS: There were 541 eligible patients entered between 1991 and 1995 and the treatment arms were balanced with respect to patient characteristics. The median follow up of patients still alive was 11.4 years. No significant difference was found between Tam plus Flu and Tam alone in terms of RFS or overall survival. The adjusted hazard ratio (Tam+Flu/Tam) for relapse or death without relapse was estimated to be 0.84 (95% CI: 0.64-1.10) and that for death was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.67-1.18). As expected there was more virilization in women who received Flu. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial did not demonstrate superiority of Tam plus Flu over Tam alone as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with resected early breast cancer known to be ER positive.\n",

The addition of rituximab to a combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone (FCM) significantly increases the response rate and prolongs survival as compared with FCM alone in patients with relapsed and refractory follicular and mantle cell lymphomas: results of a prospective randomized study of the German Low-Grade Lymphoma Study Group. TITLE END DRUG NAME: Fosfomycin In follicular lymphoma (FL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) the monoclonal antibody rituximab may improve the prognosis when combined with chemotherapy. This was investigated in a prospective randomized study in patients with relapsed disease. A total of 147 patients were randomized to receive 4 courses of chemotherapy with 25 mg/m(2) fludarabine on days 1 to 3, 200 mg/m(2) cyclophosphamide on days 1 to 3, and 8 mg/m(2) mitoxantrone on day 1 (FCM), alone or combined with rituximab (375 mg/m(2); R-FCM). Of 128 evaluable patients, 62 were randomized for FCM and 66 for R-FCM. R-FCM revealed an overall response rate of 79% (33% complete remission [CR], 45% partial remission [PR]) as compared with 58% for FCM alone (13% CR, 45% PR; P = .01), with similar results in a subgroup analysis of FL (94% vs 70%) and MCL (58% vs 46%). In the total group, the R-FCM arm was significantly superior concerning progression-free survival (PFS; P = .0381) and overall survival (OS; P = .0030). In FL PFS was significantly longer in the R-FCM arm (P = .0139) whereas in MCL a significantly longer OS was observed (P = .0042). There were no differences in clinically relevant side effects in both study arms. Hence, the addition of rituximab to FCM chemotherapy significantly improves the outcome of relapsed or refractory FL and MCL.\n",

TITLE END DRUG NAME: Glutamine Fifty-three patients with hematological malignancies who underwent Allo-SCT from HLA-identical siblings were randomly assigned to receive glutamine-enriched parenteral nutrition-PN (GlPN, n=27) or standard PN (PN, n=26), in isonitrogenous solutions. Deaths (D+100 and D+180), infections, acute GVHD, length of stay, time of neutropenia and intestinal permeability (IP) were studied. Ages, gender, diagnosis, disease status and treatment variables were equally distributed between groups. Survival on D+180 was increased in GlPN (74%) vs PN (46%), P=0.03 (log-rank), as on D+100 (P=0.05). Most deaths occurred before D+100, especially in PN (10/26, 39%) vs GlPN (4/27, 15%). GVHD was the most frequent cause of death (8/21, 38%), especially in PN (n=6, five before D+100). Other outcomes were not affected. IP was affected on admission, was not affected by glutamine enrichment, but consistently worsened throughout the study. Results showed that GlPN was efficacious in increasing short-term survival after Allo-SCT. Benefits of glutamine seem to be independent of mucosal protection, as IP was not affected by its use. A trend to a lower incidence of GVHD deaths may suggest an immunomodulatory role of glutamine.\n",

TITLE END DRUG NAME: Glutathione A clinical trial of a protracted adjuvant cancer chemotherapy was carried out on 207 patients with operable gastric cancer, from April, 1977, in the First Department of Surgery, Chiba University Hospital and two closely related hospitals. These patients were given intravenously 0.4 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg of mitomycin C on the day of operation and the next day, respectively, and then 16 mg/kg intravenously of Futraful (FT-207) daily from the 10th postoperative day until discharge, followed by oral administration of FT-207, 12 mg/kg, for 24 to 36 months after discharge. Two mg/kg of phenobarbital and 30 mg/kg of glutathione were administered randomly to half the number of patients (induction group) to induce hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Significantly higher levels of serum 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) released from FT-207 were found in the induction group than in the controls. Five-year overall survival rates in the induction and control groups revealed no difference. However, the survival rates in Stage III patients in the induction group were significantly superior in the 3-5 postoperative years, compared to those in the Stage III of the control group, while Stage I, II and IV patients apparently received no benefit from this induction treatment.\n",

TITLE END DRUG NAME: Hydrocortisone 222 patients with disseminated breast cancer have been randomised to receive either a combination of hormone therapies using tamoxifen, aminoglutethimide with hydrocortisone, and danazol (TAD), or tamoxifen alone. The response to the combination was significantly better (43%) than that to tamoxifen alone (31%). Patients who relapsed after response or failed to respond to tamoxifen were subsequently treated with aminoglutethimide and then, if possible, with danazol. Some patients who received TAD were subsequently treated with alternative endocrine therapy, which was usually medroxyprogesterone acetate. Of the 111 patients who initially received tamoxifen, 43 responded to the tamoxifen and/or subsequent endocrine therapy. Of the 111 patients who initially received TAD, 50 responded. Although the duration of response to TAD was the same as for tamoxifen, the TAD patients achieved remission more quickly. The total time in endocrine remission for patients receiving TAD is 303 months to date, compared with 264 months for patients receiving tamoxifen. Survival for patients randomised to receive TAD or tamoxifen is the same.\n",

TITLE END DRUG NAME: Levothyroxine PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of bexarotene on survival in patients with relapsed non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB NSCLC with pleural effusion or stage IV NSCLC, who had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, and were previously treated with > or = two different regimens that must have included a platinum and a taxane, received oral bexarotene 400 mg/m2/d plus concomitant levothyroxine and a lipid-lowering agent. Primary efficacy end point was survival. RESULTS: For the 146 assessable patients treated with bexarotene, median age was 66 years (range, 34 to 87 years), 51% were men, and the median number of prior regimens was three (range, one to seven). The overall median survival was 5 months (95% CI, 4 to 7 months) and the 1-year survival was 23% (95% CI, 16% to 31%). Survival was significantly longer in patients with bexarotene-induced hypertriglyceridemia and/or skin rash. In 26 patients who had both adverse effects, the median and 1-year survival rates were 12 months (95% CI, 8 to 15 months) and 48%, respectively. In 40 patients who had neither adverse effect, median and 1-year survival rates were 2 months (95% CI, 2 to 5 months) and 15%, respectively (P = .0002). Twenty patients (14%) discontinued therapy because of bexarotene-related toxicity. For the remaining patients, adverse reactions to bexarotene were generally mild to moderate. CONCLUSION: In the intent-to-treat population, bexarotene given as third or subsequent line of therapy for relapsed NSCLC did not achieve the intended median survival of 6 months. Survival may have been extended in patients who developed bexarotene-induced hypertriglyceremia and/or skin rash. It is important to confirm these observations in a randomized controlled trial.\n",

TITLE END DRUG NAME: Nitric Oxide OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of low-dose glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) on men with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after primary therapy. Preclinical, proof-of-principle studies have demonstrated that nitric oxide signaling plays a significant role in the hypoxia-induced progression of prostate cancer. METHODS: A prospective, open-label clinical trial of men with an increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level after surgery or radiotherapy was conducted. Men with PSA recurrence were enrolled in a 24-month trial investigating the effect of a low-dose, slow-release transdermal GTN patch. The PSA doubling time (PSADT) was compared before and after treatment initiation, as well as with a matched control group that received no immediate treatment for their PSA recurrence. RESULTS: A total of 29 patients were enrolled in the study. Of the 29 patients, 62% completed the 24-month protocol, with 10% experiencing clinical disease progression. The calculated PSADT of the treatment group before initiating GTN was 13.3 months, not significantly different from that of the matched control group at 12.8 months. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the end-of-study PSADT for the treatment group was significantly different at 31.8 months (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We report the first clinical trial of a GTN patch in patients with prostate cancer. The prolongation of the PSADT and the safety of the drug, coupled with the corresponding preclinical in vitro and in vivo data documenting the ability of nitric oxide to attenuate hypoxia-induced progression of prostate cancer, warrant further testing in a placebo-controlled study.\n",

Phase III study of pasireotide long-acting release in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors and carcinoid symptoms refractory to available somatostatin analogues. TITLE END DRUG NAME: Pasireotide In a randomized, double-blind, Phase III study, we compared pasireotide long-acting release (pasireotide LAR) with octreotide long-acting repeatable (octreotide LAR) in managing carcinoid symptoms refractory to first-generation somatostatin analogues. Adults with carcinoid tumors of the digestive tract were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive pasireotide LAR (60 mg) or octreotide LAR (40 mg) every 28 days. Primary outcome was symptom control based on frequency of bowel movements and flushing episodes. Objective tumor response was a secondary outcome. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated in a post hoc analysis. Adverse events were recorded. At the time of a planned interim analysis, the data monitoring committee recommended halting the study because of a low predictive probability of showing superiority of pasireotide over octreotide for symptom control (n=43 pasireotide LAR, 20.9%; n=45 octreotide LAR, 26.7%; odds ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-1.97; P=0.53). Tumor control rate at month 6 was 62.7% with pasireotide and 46.2% with octreotide (odds ratio, 1.96; 95% CI, 0.89-4.32; P=0.09). Median (95% CI) PFS was 11.8 months (11.0 - not reached) with pasireotide versus 6.8 months (5.6 - not reached) with octreotide (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.20-0.98; P=0.045). The most frequent drug-related adverse events (pasireotide vs octreotide) included hyperglycemia (28.3% vs 5.3%), fatigue (11.3% vs 3.5%), and nausea (9.4% vs 0%). We conclude that, among patients with carcinoid symptoms refractory to available somatostatin analogues, similar proportions of patients receiving pasireotide LAR or octreotide LAR achieved symptom control at month 6. Pasireotide LAR showed a trend toward higher tumor control rate at month 6, although it was statistically not significant, and was associated with a longer PFS than octreotide LAR.\n",

Prognostic significance of glucocorticoid receptor determination in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and immunocytoma--lack of a positive correlation between receptor levels and clinical responsiveness. TITLE END DRUG NAME: Prednimustine Glucocorticoid receptors (GR) have been suggested to have prognostic significance in patients with CLL treated with chemotherapy containing glucocorticoid. In this study, the GR levels in 65 patients with advanced CLL and immunocytoma (clinical stages III and IV according to Rai) were determined by means of a whole cell assay. The median GR-level was 1,920 bs/c with a range from 0 to 9591. The patients were subsequently treated according to a prospective, randomized trial with either a combination of chlorambucil and prednisolone, or with prednimustine. No significant difference in receptor levels was found between responders (median = 1940 bs/c; n = 47) and nonresponders (median = 1950 bs/c; n = 14). To assess the influence of receptor content on prognosis we have analyzed the relationship between GR content and survival time and duration of response. There was no significant difference in duration of response and in survival between those patients with high (greater than 1920 bs/c) and those with low GR levels (less than 1920 bs/c) (log-rank test). Our data suggest that determination of GR provides no reliable indicator for clinical response to regimens with glucocorticoid as a component in patients with CLL and immunocytoma.\n",

TITLE END DRUG NAME: Rivaroxaban BACKGROUND/AIMS: Limited data are available regarding the efficacy of rivaroxaban for the treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban for the treatment of VTE in active cancer patients. METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, open-label trial (NCT01989845), we enrolled patients with active cancer and objectively diagnosed lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism (PE), or both from November 2013 to June 2016. Active cancer was defined as a histologically confirmed malignancy, which was diagnosed or treated within the previous 6 months, or as a recurrent/ metastatic cancer. Patients received oral rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for first 3 weeks, followed by 20 mg once daily for 6 months. The primary outcome was the symptomatic recurrent VTE and the secondary outcomes included any recurrent VTE, major or clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding events, and overall mortality. All study outcomes were validated by blinded central adjudication. RESULTS: Of 124 patients enrolled, 110 (88.7%) had solid cancer, 93 (75.0%) had metastatic disease, and 110 (88.7%) were receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy. During the 6-month study period, seven patients experienced symptomatic recurrent VTE (cumulative incidence, 5.9%), and two patients experienced incidental recurrent PE (cumulative incidence of any recurrent VTE, 7.6%). Major bleeding events occurred in six patients (cumulative incidence, 5.3%) and CRNM bleeding events in 11 patients (cumulative incidence, 10.2%). Twenty-eight patients (overall mortality, 24.0%) died. CONCLUSION: Rivaroxaban is effective and safe for the treatment of VTE in patients with active cancer.\n",

TITLE END DRUG NAME: Rosiglitazone BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the biologic activity of rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist that has been approved to treat type 2 diabetes, in men with recurrent prostate carcinoma using change in prostate specific antigen (PSA) doubling time (PSADT) as the primary outcome variable. METHODS: Men with histologically confirmed prostate carcinoma, no recent hormone therapy, a rising serum PSA level after radical prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy, and no radiographic evidence of metastases were assigned randomly to receive either oral rosiglitazone (4 mg twice daily) or placebo. The treatment was continued until the men developed disease progression or adverse effects. A positive outcome was defined as a posttreatment PSADT > 150% the baseline PSADT and no new metastases. RESULTS: One hundred six men were enrolled. The median treatment duration was 315 days for men in the placebo group and 338 days for men in the rosiglitazone group (P = 0.28). Forty percent of men in the in the placebo group and 38% of men in the rosiglitazone group had a posttreatment PSADT > 150% of the baseline PSADT and no new metastases (P = 1.00). In exploratory analyses, the rate of a positive outcome remained higher than expected in the placebo group, even when a positive outcome was redefined using more stringent criteria. The time to disease progression was similar between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Rosiglitazone did not increase PSADT or prolong the time to disease progression more than placebo in men with a rising PSA level after radical prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy. The unexpected discordance between baseline and posttreatment PSADT in the placebo group reinforced the importance of randomized controlled trials in this setting.\n",

TITLE END DRUG NAME: Sulfanilamide BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is the standard of care for advanced stages of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). TG4010 is a targeted immunotherapy based on a poxvirus (modified vaccinia virus Ankara) that codes for MUC1 tumour-associated antigen and interleukin 2. This study assessed TG4010 in combination with first-line chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC. METHODS: 148 patients with advanced (stage IIIB [wet] or IV) NSCLC expressing MUC1 by immunohistochemistry, and with performance status 0 or 1, were enrolled in parallel groups in this open-label, phase 2B study. 74 patients were allocated to the combination therapy group, and received TG4010 (10(8) plaque forming units) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m(2) on day 1) and gemcitabine (1250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8) repeated every 3 weeks for up to six cycles. 74 patients allocated to the control group received the same chemotherapy alone. Patients were allocated using a dynamic minimisation procedure stratified by centre, performance status, and disease stage. The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), with a target rate of 40% or higher in the experimental group. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This study is completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00415818. FINDINGS: 6-month PFS was 43.2% (32 of 74; 95% CI 33.4-53.5) in the TG4010 plus chemotherapy group, and 35.1% (26 of 74; 25.9-45.3) in the chemotherapy alone group. Fever, abdominal pain, and injection-site pain of any grade according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria were more common in the TG4010 group than in the chemotherapy alone group: 17 of 73 patients (23.3%) versus six of 72 (8.3%), 12 (16.4%) versus two (2.8%), and four (5.5%) versus zero (0%), respectively. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (33 [45.2%] of patients in the TG4010 plus chemotherapy group vs 31 [43.1%] in the chemotherapy alone group) and fatigue (18 [24.7%] vs 13 [18.1%]); the only grade 3-4 events that differed significantly between groups were anorexia (three [4.1%] vs 10 [13.9%]) and pleural effusion (none vs four [5.6%]). 38 of 73 patients (52.1%) in the TG4010 plus chemotherapy group and 34 of 72 (47.2%) in the chemotherapy alone group had at least one serious adverse event. INTERPRETATION: This phase 2B study suggests that TG4010 enhances the effect of chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC. A confirmatory phase 2B-3 trial has been initiated.

TITLE END DRUG NAME: Vitamin D BACKGROUND: Some studies have demonstrated that higher baseline plasma levels of 25-hydroxivitamin D [25(OH)D] are associated with a significant reduction in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence. Patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) tend to be vitamin D insufficient, but the effect of vitamin D on the survival of mCRC patients still remains uncertain. In this study, we evaluated the association between cholecalciferol 2,000 IU daily supplementation and survival of mCRC patients. METHODS: Seventy-two patients with mCRC were included. Seventy-one patients with 25(OH)D levels <75 nmol/l were randomized to receive standard chemotherapy or standard chemotherapy with cholecalciferol 2,000 IU daily. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) and the secondary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The follow-up period was 46 mo. RESULTS: All but one patient (98.6%) was vitamin D insufficient. There was no statistically significant difference in OS or PFS between those who received vitamin D supplements and controls. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with mCRC are vitamin D insufficient at the time of diagnosis. In our study, adding 2,000 IU of cholecalciferol daily for 2 yr to standard chemotherapy did not show any benefit in OS or PFS.\n",

A trend toward improved survival with warfarin treatment was observed for the few patients admitted to this study with non-small cell lung cancer who had minimal disease at randomization. These results suggest that warfarin, as a single anticoagulant agent, may favorably modify the course of some, but not all, types of human malignancy, among which is small cell carcinoma of the lung. Further trials of warfarin may be indicated in patients with limited disease who have cell types that failed to respond when advanced disease was present.\n"
